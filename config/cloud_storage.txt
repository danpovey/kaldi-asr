We store model files in Google Cloud Storage.

You can upload files to Cloud Storage either through the Google Cloud
Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/storage) or the gcloud
command line utility.

To use gcloud, download and install the latest Google Cloud SDK
(https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs)

Then use the following command to upload your model file into
Cloud Storage:

gsutil cp my-model.tar.gz gs://kaldi-asr/models/my-model.tar.gz
