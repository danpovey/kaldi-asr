			<h4 class="kaldiStyle tutorialStyle">Information for participants</h4>
				The current version of the <a href="downloads/tutorial-materials/ibt-data/BABEL_TT_Tutorial_Khudanpur.pdf">tutorial slides</a>. <b>Updated on 2017-02-16</b>.
			
			<h4 class="kaldiStyle tutorialStyle">Preliminary: Logging onto a machine</h4>
				<h5 class="kaldiStyle tutorialStyle">GNU&nbsp;Linux, Unix, MacOS&nbsp;X</h5>
					Using the provided SSH <a href="/downloads/tutorial-materials/ibt-data/ibt-public.pem.txt" download>private key</a>, login on an assigned machine.
					Using the command line SSH, this can be done using the following command:
					
					<pre class="kaldiStyle tutorialStyle">
					ssh -i ibt-public.pem.txt ubuntu@&lt;machine-name&gt;
					</pre>
					
					where <samp>&lt;machine-name&gt;</samp> is the address of the machine with the same number you've been assigned.
					Please note that after downloading, you might need to change the access rights to the file <samp>ibt-public.pem.txt</samp>
					to allow only the current user to read the file (it's a security precaution built-in into OpenSSH clients).
					This can be done using the following command
		
					<pre class="kaldiStyle tutorialStyle">
					chmod 600 ibt-public.pem.txt
					</pre>
		
				<h5 class="kaldiStyle tutorialStyle">MS&nbsp;Windows</h5>
					For MS&nbsp;Windows, no SSH client is comming as a standard part of the OS. We suggest to install 
					<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>. We provide additional information
					about PuTTY setup <a href="ibt-putty.html">here</a>. Please note that PuTTY needs the private key
					in a special format. You can download the key <a href="/downloads/tutorial-materials/ibt-data/ibt-public.ppk" download>here</a>.

				<h5 class="kaldiStyle tutorialStyle">Testing the SSH</h5>
					You can use the machine name <samp>ec2-54-204-202-208.compute-1.amazonaws.com</samp> to login in order to verify your setup works.
					That machine is solely for the purpose of testing the connection procedure, it does not have enough CPUs nor memory to be 
					usable for running the scripts.

			<h4 class="kaldiStyle tutorialStyle">Running the recipe</h4>
				Once you've log in, run the command <samp>screen</samp>. That command ensures that even if the connection to the machine is dropped, 
				the scripts will still keep running, so you won't have to run everything from scratch.
				<p>
				In case you need to restore the connection (for example after a lunch break), use the command <code>screen -ls</code> to see the already opened sessions.
				Use the session name (looking something like <code>2101.pts-0.ip-10-37-174-80</code> as a parameter of <code>screen -rd</code> to connect to that session.
				See the following example. Your session name can look different! Also, it is possible to see two (or even more) sessions, especially in case you were working
				in pairs (but each on their own computer). You can guess which is the right by looking at the date of the session and it's state. You want to primarily consider
				the sessions that are in "Dettached" state.
				<pre style="color:gray;margin-left:2em;">
ubuntu@ip-10-37-174-80:~$ screen -ls
There is a screen on:
2101.pts-0.ip-10-37-174-80(02/15/2017 05:28:36 PM)(Attached)
1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-ubuntu.

ubuntu@ip-10-37-174-80:~$ screen -rd 2101.pts-0.ip-10-37-174-80
				</pre> 
				<p>
				The recipe is in <samp>~/kaldi/egs/iban/s5</samp>. Everything should be set up correctly for you, so that you can go 
				ahead and run the script <samp>run.sh</samp>. We will use <samp>tee</samp> to keep the console output in the log file for a future reference.
				
				<pre class="kaldiStyle tutorialStyle">
				~/kaldi/egs/iban/s5 $ ./run.sh 2>&1 | tee run.log
				</pre>

				It will take a two or three hours to finish.
				After the script finishes, you can run another script, providing training procedure for TDNN acoustic models. 
				That script is <samp>./local/nnet3/run_tdnn.sh</samp>. It is inteded to be run from the same directory in which 
				the script <samp>run.sh</samp> lies, i.e. should be executed as
				
				<pre class="kaldiStyle tutorialStyle">
				~/kaldi/egs/iban/s5 $ ./local/nnet3/run_tdnn.sh 2>&1 | tee run-tdnn.log
				</pre>


			  <h4 class="kaldiStyle tutorialStyle">List of machines</h4>
				<!-- For now, we do not provide any publicly available machines (except the testing one mentioned above that should be used only to verify your SSH client works).
				The tutorial participants will be provided with an access to a machine during the course of the workshop. -->

				The machines are no longer available. You can use the machine <samp>ec2-54-204-202-208.compute-1.amazonaws.com</samp> to look at the files and sniff around. 
				Do not run the scripts, please. The machine does not have enough memory (nor cpus) to do anything else than just host the fully trained system.
				
<!--The following <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZgRtPKg-y-JHREyBcianPtaqTclpRKmzPtEbUBE8yig/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheat</a> contains a list of machines available for public use.
Choose one that is not used yet (the field Team/Name is empty) and write your 
name/nick/team name into the given field. -->

				<p>
				The Iban recipe is a part of the Kaldi standard egs. The data are publicly available (see <a href="http://www.openslr.org/24/">http://www.openslr.org/24/</a>). 
				You can train the system using your own local machine/cluster. For the basic HMM/GMM/SGMM systems you don't need a machine with GPUs!
				<p>
				If you have (or your institution has) access to the AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud, you can run an instance with exactly the same setup 
				you will have access to during the tutorial. This might come useful even after tutorial ends and the tutorial machines won't be available.
				We have published two AWS (Amazon Web Services) AMI images "v4 IBAN recipe/Ubuntu 14.04LTS" (<samp>AMI-ID ami-7b688916</samp>) 
				and "v5 IBAN recipe/Ubuntu 14.04LTS" (<samp>AMI-ID ami-6945a804</samp>). The difference between the two is that "v4" has a complete setup, 
				but does not contain the files created during training. The "v5" contains fully trained and decoded system.
